## Introduction

This is a list of open source applications for Android, as always, the list is written in a [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) simple way, the apps in the list are divided by category.
Feel free to [contact me](https://brainfucksec.github.io/contacts) to add applications or modify the list.

### About links

Application links in the list are related to one of these resources:

- The App/Project Website
- The App's source code website/page (git repositories such as GitHub, Codebase etc.)
- The repository page on F-Droid

_If in addition to these sources I'm having trouble finding the source code, I do not list the Application_. See: - [Some little rules of the list](#some-little-rules-of-the-list)

## F-Droid Applications

### Search the Applications

You can use different methods to search for Applications in the F-Droid repositories:

- The [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) App.
- One of the F-Droid fork apps, like [Droid-ify](https://droidify.eu.org/) or [Neo Store](https://github.com/NeoApplications/Neo-Store).
- The websites of F-Droid and IzzyOnDroid:
  - <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/>
  - <https://apt.izzysoft.de/fdroid/index.php>

### Repositories

Here you will find a complete list of repositories supported by F-Droid and a simple guide on how to add them:

[F-Droid - Known Repositories: <https://forum.f-droid.org/t/known-repositories/721>](https://forum.f-droid.org/t/known-repositories/721)

See: [App Repositories](#app-repositories)

## Some little rules of the list

The Applications included in the list match the following parameters, the parameter list is not complete at this time, and there may be exceptions. See: [Disclaimer](#disclaimer)

- Source code is not findable/easily available.
- Applications whose download is exclusively on Google Play.
- There are no repositories on F-Droid, GitHub etc, consequently the application cannot be updated easily.
- The project/app has not been updated for some time or is no longer maintained (i.e., archived status): _Generally, Applications are removed from the list after 1 year or so that the package/release is not updated. This is with exceptions based on the type of Application, or if for example it is still valid and there is no alternative._
- Applications that aren't really fundamental (like Wi-Fi On/Off, Show my IP Address, various Flashlights etc.)

Security:

Security related applications such as file encryption, password managers etc. are included if they are stable and tested by many users, so usually the most popular applications are included.
However, it is not a mandatory parameter.
